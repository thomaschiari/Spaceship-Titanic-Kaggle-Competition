# Spaceship Titanic Competition

This is a repository for the Spaceship Titanic Competition in Kaggle, used by the Kaggle 1 Insper Dynamics team. 
This repository will be mostly used for practicing and testing the code for future, more complex competitions.

### Submissions
- `Submission1`: Uses a Random Forest Classifier, with 100 trees, using `scikit-learn` library (more info on the notebook `Spaceship-Titanic.ipynb`).
- `Submission2`: Uses a Logistic Regression Classifier, with `scikit-learn` library, and applies Feature Selection and Engineering techniques (more info on the notebook `Spaceship-Titanic-LogReg.ipynb`).
- `Submission3`: Uses a Random Forest Classifier, using `tensorflow-decision-forests` library, with default parameters and configurations (more info on the notebook `ST_TFDF.ipynb`).
